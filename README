/**
The Novice Programmer ~ EP03 Rectangle Collision

In today's episode, I work on a simple collision detection program which will identify when two rectangles collide/overlap on a 2D coordinate plane. I implement a simple class to define a rectangle shape (with an inner class to define its origin position on the coordinate plane), then run two simple JUnit test cases to validate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) algorithm.

Language used for the project: Java
